### Contract System to Allow Decentralized and Fluid Enterprises

This repository contains a contract system designed to enable the creation and management of decentralized, fluid enterprises. Our approach eschews traditional corporate structures by using hexadecimal codes derived from hash functions instead of names and logos. These enterprises are designed to be highly adaptable, automatically dividing when they grow beyond certain thresholds to maintain efficiency and focus on service excellence.

Key Features:

- Decentralized Identification: Each enterprise is identified by a unique hexadecimal code, eliminating the need for conventional branding.
- Automatic Division: Enterprises are programmed to split into smaller, more manageable units upon reaching predefined growth limits.
- Dynamic Structuring: The system supports fluid organizational changes, allowing companies to reconfigure themselves based on market needs and operational demands.
- Service-Centric Model: Emphasizes providing the highest quality service by removing traditional corporate distractions and focusing solely on performance and customer satisfaction.
- Blockchain Integration: Utilizes smart contracts to automate and ensure transparent operations and adherence to agreements.
